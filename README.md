### Problem Specification

Design and implement an elevator control system. What data structures,
interfaces and algorithms will you need? Your elevator control system should
be able to handle a few elevators -- up to 16.

You can use the language of your choice to implement an elevator control
system. In the end, your control system should provide an interface for:

  * Querying the state of the elevators (what floor are they on and where they
    are going),

  * receiving an update about the status of an elevator,

  * receiving a pickup request,

  * time-stepping the simulation.

For example, we could imagine in Scala an interface like this:

  trait ElevatorControlSystem {
    def status(): Seq[(Int, Int, Int)]
    def update(Int, Int, Int)
    def pickup(Int, Int)
    def step()
  }

Here we have chosen to represent elevator state as 3 integers:

  Elevator ID, Floor Number, Goal Floor Number

An update alters these numbers for one elevator. A pickup request is two
integers:

  Pickup Floor, Direction (negative for down, positive for up)

This is not a particularly nice interface, and leaves some questions open. For
example, the elevator state only has one goal floor; but it is conceivable
that an elevator holds more than one person, and each person wants to go to a
different floor, so there could be a few goal floors queued up.

=========================================

Build the Elevator Control System:
  - go build

Start the Elevator Control System:
  - $ ./main (number of elevators)
  - e.g. start with 2 elevators: $ ./main -n 2

Improvements to Scheduling:
  - The elevator moves in the same direction as long as there are goalFloorNumber stored in the map of the elevator
  - If the goalFloorNumber is empty, the elevator will go into an idle state and change the direction if
    there are requests in the opposite direction
